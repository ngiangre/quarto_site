# 🌳Welcome to my digital garden🌳 {style="text-align: center"}

**This is where I tend to personal and open source projects. I'm a scientist who loves to investigate the world! Projects are a mixture of scientific communication, coding, and maybe just a collection of writings. Additionally, I may just write a post to record a nascent idea, announcement, standalone essay, or the beginning of a new project! I'll use GitHub to keep track of progress as well as discussion with others interested in this digital space. I hope you enjoy your stay in my digital space** 😁
