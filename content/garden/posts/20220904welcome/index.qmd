Hello! This is exciting for a couple of reasons:

-   This is the redesign of my [original website](nickgiangreco.netlify.app)

-   This redesigned website is made using [Quarto](quarto.org)

-   This redesigned website is now hosting my digital garden

In this post, I want to briefly describe:

1.  [The concept of a digital garden, and why I am creating one for myself.](#nick's-digital-garden)

2.  The structure and content of my garden.

3.  how will I "tend to" my digital garden.

4.  What is "growing" in my digital garden (i.e. what is up next).
